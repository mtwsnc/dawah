## About

Information About Islam is a comprehensive website designed to provide accurate and accessible information about Islam to both Muslims and non-Muslims alike. The project aims to:

- Offer authentic Islamic knowledge based on the Quran and Sunnah
- Provide resources for new Muslims and those interested in learning about Islam
- Make Islamic educational materials accessible in multiple formats (text, audio, video)
- Present Islamic teachings in a clear, user-friendly interface

This website serves as a digital da'wah (invitation to Islam) platform, addressing common questions about Islamic beliefs, practices, and principles. It includes resources such as audiobooks, prayer guides, Quran recitations, and educational content about core Islamic concepts.

- SASS/SCSS for CSS preprocessing
- Custom JavaScript for audio players, modals, and interactive elements
- Google Analytics and Microsoft Clarity for website analytics
